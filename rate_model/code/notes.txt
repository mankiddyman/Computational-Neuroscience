what if we model how the brain waves change  in response to a changing stimulus instead of being shown a static one since we can freely change i_E_L4


I fixed the lack of oscillation in SOM by changing the excitation from the excitatory population but I dont know why the parameters behave the way that they domain

Now I updated the fourier transform with new functions and found a way to make them make sense by restricting the stuff to when the system is stably oscillating


increased the time of the simulation
it seems that the guys are damped oscillating, need to ask bossman how to find out which params can be modified sensibly
